“Mockingbirds don’t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.


# #2 TRAÇABILITÉ

I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.


We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with our desires—we believe it because otherwise we can see no favourable outcome. We do not think of the outcome which generally comes to pass and is also favourable: we do not succeed in changing things in accordance with our desires, but gradually our desires change. The situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us beyond it, and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become.

# #3 IMPACT 

The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.

# #4 RECYCLAGE ♻️

Note de recyclabilité : **8/12**

🧵Ce mélange de matières ne peut pas être séparé en fils distincts dans les filières de recyclage actuelles.

🏭Déposé en centre de tri, il peut participer à l’élaboration de nouveaux matériaux (composites, isolation, rembourrage).

✅Le mieux reste de lui trouver une nouvelle propriétaire pour une deuxième vie!
